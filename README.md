To predict Tesla's stock price using regression, follow these steps:

1. *Data Collection*:
   - Gather historical Tesla stock price data.
   - Collect relevant financial indicators (e.g., trading volume, market indices) and external factors (e.g., interest rates).

2. *Data Preprocessing*:
   - Clean and normalize the data.

3. *Feature Selection*:
   - Choose features like historical prices, trading volume, market indices, and economic indicators.

4. *Model Selection*:
   - Use regression models such as Linear Regression, LASSO, or more advanced models like Random Forest or Neural Networks.

5. *Model Training*:
   - Split data into training and testing sets and train the model.

6. *Model Evaluation*:
   - Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or RÂ².

7. *Prediction*:
   - Predict future stock prices with the trained model.
